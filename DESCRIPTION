Description: Implementation of CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics feature sets and associated
    statistical visualisations in R. Includes previously developed sets such as catch22 and 
    CAnonical Time-series Characteristics for Mouse fMRI (catchaMouse16). Calculates summary 
    statistics for select reduced-redundancy time-series features sets on input vectors to 
    enable pattern detection, similarity, classification, and regression applications in the 
    feature space. All calculations are coded in C and C++ for computational efficiency 
    and scalability to large datasets.
